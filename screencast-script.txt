In 1983, following successes such as 1978's "Space Invaders," 1980's "Pac-Man," and 1981's "Donkey Kong," the video game industry in North America took a nose dive. Publication of low-quality games and market oversaturization caused the bankruptcy of many top video game companies. The end of this crash was marked by the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States.

So, how did this industry recover? In this visualization, we set out to answer this question and more. What best-selling games made economic recovery possible for which publishers over what time period? How did genre-preference shift for consumers over time?

To do this, we used the data set simply titled, "video_games_dataset.csv," made available on Kaggle by user A. Ingle, to plot the cross-product of 5 different variables across the years 1982 to 2016.

The barcharts shown can be categorized using a dropdown. This allows the user to select which variable will be shown on each of the charts, and this information is encoded using categorical colors.

Barcharts can be added to the visualization using checkboxes. These barcharts group the variable selected in the dropdown into either games, platforms, genre, region, or publisher. Use of the dropdown in combination with these checkboxes allows the user to view a multitude of relationships in the data.

The slider, marked with various years available in the data, serves two functions. First, a single point in time can be referenced. Second, a range of years can be selected. Clicking the "Go!" button begins a journey through the selected data range. During this animation, each barchart is coordinated; so, the user may observed trends through time over several different variables.

This visualization allows the user to confidently answer questions regarding the details of video game sales over time by providing a ton of different avenues for visualizing the variables relevant to their questions.
